# ESG-investing-using-expected-shortfall-as-a-measure-of-risk

Repository for my Master Thesis, including the code used and the presentation

This study examines the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores on the risk and returns of investment portfolios through empirical analysis, with a particular focus on the Expected Shortfall (ES) as the measure of risk. It compares the performance of portfolios that adhere to ESG criteria with those that do not. The goal is to determine whether incorporating ESG principles into investment strategies can reduce the potential for losses and enhance financial returns. The research seeks to provide concrete evidence on how ESG investing can contribute to risk reduction and possibly increase returns for investors.
